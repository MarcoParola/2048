ADDED 2 FILES .js

To run this app on mobile I added this files. If device is a mobile they change the style of some
htlm-elements and the events to move on the grid. 
The result isn't perfect, to realize a nice mobile app I should develop it on a framework on purpose,
but I hope this solution will have you entertained.

You can't put them in the real project, because I changed some path and some exstention of some files,
to realize a demo of application, you can find it at ( http://marcoparola.atwebpages.com/index.html ).
